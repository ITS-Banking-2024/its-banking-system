"""
In this file, a Container class is defined that uses dependency_injector to manage the dependencies of the application.
The container declares three dependencies: config, product_service, and order_service.
config is a configuration provider, while product_service and order_service are singletons that provide instances
of ProductService and OrderService, respectively.
Additionally, a product_factory is defined as a factory provider that creates instances of the Product model.
